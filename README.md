## About this project

AVRliberty is a library of easy-to-use C functions for a variety of common and
uncommon tasks using AVR processors. It is the open source project heavily based
on original Procyon AVRlib
http://www.procyonengineering.com/embedded/avr/avrlib/.

## Why was this project created?

The goal of original Procyon AVRlib was to allow programmers to work quickly
towards their end goal by reducing the time needed to write basic support
functions and code.

Unfortunately (as of 3/28/2012) last known official release of AVRlib was dated
September 20, 2005 - more than 7 years ago.

Atmel and other vendors continue release new hardware every day. Also there's
some places in original avrlib waiting to be improved or rewritten. So with all
the respect to Pascal Stang, author of original library, I decided to start
AVRliberty to let present day developers to cooperate while maintaining and
expanding AVRlib.
